grunt express server with compass and livereload
============

Wasn't as intuitive as expected to setup so I'm saving this as as starting point.

## Requirements

`node-compass` requires the compass ruby gem in order to compile compass.
This can easily be installed via Terminal.
    
    $ gem update --system
    $ gem install compass

You'll want to do that as a root user

## Installation

    npm install

## Usage

grunt server.
